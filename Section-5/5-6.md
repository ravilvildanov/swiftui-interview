# What is the difference between `NavigationLink` and `PresentationLink`?

In SwiftUI, `NavigationLink` and `PresentationLink` are two types of links that allow you to navigate to a new view, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

**`NavigationLink`**

A `NavigationLink` is a type of link that navigates to a new view within a navigation stack. It's commonly used to create a hierarchical navigation flow, where users can drill down into more detailed views and then navigate back to the previous views.

Here are some key characteristics of `NavigationLink`:

* Navigates to a new view within a navigation stack
* Creates a hierarchical navigation flow
* Typically used with `NavigationView` to manage the navigation stack
* Can be used with `NavigationLink` instances to create a navigation flow
* Can be customized with navigation bar titles, buttons, and other elements

Example:
```swift
struct MyApp: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                Text("Go to Detail View")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**`PresentationLink`**

A `PresentationLink` is a type of link that presents a new view modally, such as a sheet or a full-screen cover. It's commonly used to create a modal presentation flow, where users can interact with a view that's presented on top of another view.

Here are some key characteristics of `PresentationLink`:

* Presents a new view modally, such as a sheet or a full-screen cover
* Creates a modal presentation flow
* Typically used with `sheet` or `fullScreenCover` modifiers to customize the presentation
* Can be used with `@Environment(\.presentationMode)` to dismiss the modal view
* Can be customized with modal presentation styles, such as `.automatic`, `.sheet`, or `.fullScreen`

Example:
```swift
struct MyApp: View {
    @State private var isPresented = false

    var body: some View {
        PresentationLink(destination: ModalView(), presentation: $isPresented) {
            Text("Present Modal View")
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented) {
            ModalView()
        }
    }
}
```
**Key differences**

Here are the main differences between `NavigationLink` and `PresentationLink`:

* **Navigation style**: `NavigationLink` is used for hierarchical navigation, while `PresentationLink` is used for modal presentation.
* **Navigation flow**: `NavigationLink` creates a navigation stack, while `PresentationLink` presents a view modally.
* **User interaction**: `NavigationLink` typically uses a navigation bar to navigate between views, while `PresentationLink` uses a modal presentation style to present a view.

In summary, `NavigationLink` is used for creating hierarchical navigation flows, while `PresentationLink` is used for creating modal presentation flows.
