# What is the difference between `NavigationView` and `TabView`?

In SwiftUI, `NavigationView` and `TabView` are two distinct types of views that serve different purposes in creating user interfaces.

**`NavigationView`**

A `NavigationView` is a view that manages a navigation stack, allowing users to navigate between multiple views. It's commonly used to create a hierarchical navigation flow, where users can drill down into more detailed views and then navigate back to the previous views.

Here are some key characteristics of `NavigationView`:

* Manages a navigation stack
* Allows users to navigate between multiple views
* Typically used for hierarchical navigation
* Can be used with `NavigationLink` to create navigation flows
* Can be customized with navigation bar titles, buttons, and other elements

Example:
```swift
struct MyApp: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                Text("Go to Detail View")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**`TabView`**

A `TabView` is a view that displays a collection of views, each associated with a tab item. It's commonly used to create a tab-based interface, where users can switch between different views by tapping on tabs.

Here are some key characteristics of `TabView`:

* Displays a collection of views, each associated with a tab item
* Allows users to switch between different views by tapping on tabs
* Typically used for flat navigation, where users can switch between multiple views at the same level
* Can be customized with tab items, icons, and other elements

Example:
```swift
struct MyApp: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            View1()
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "house")
                    Text("Home")
                }
            View2()
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "gear")
                    Text("Settings")
                }
        }
    }
}
```
**Key differences**

Here are the main differences between `NavigationView` and `TabView`:

* **Navigation style**: `NavigationView` is used for hierarchical navigation, while `TabView` is used for flat navigation.
* **Navigation flow**: `NavigationView` manages a navigation stack, while `TabView` displays a collection of views associated with tab items.
* **User interaction**: `NavigationView` typically uses `NavigationLink` to navigate between views, while `TabView` uses tab items to switch between views.

In summary, `NavigationView` is used for creating hierarchical navigation flows, while `TabView` is used for creating tab-based interfaces with flat navigation.
