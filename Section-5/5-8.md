# What is the purpose of the `@State` property wrapper in navigation?

In SwiftUI, the `@State` property wrapper is used to create a source of truth for a view's state. In the context of navigation, `@State` is used to store the current navigation state, such as the selected tab or the presented view.

Here are some purposes of `@State` in navigation:

**1. Store navigation state**

`@State` is used to store the current navigation state, such as the selected tab, the presented view, or the navigation path. This allows the view to remember its navigation state and update accordingly.

**2. Bind to navigation views**

`@State` is used to bind to navigation views, such as `TabView`, `NavigationView`, or `PresentationLink`. This allows the view to update its navigation state in response to user interactions, such as tapping on a tab or presenting a view.

**3. Drive navigation transitions**

`@State` is used to drive navigation transitions, such as animating between views or presenting a view modally. By updating the `@State` property, the view can trigger a navigation transition and update its appearance accordingly.

**4. Enable navigation gestures**

`@State` is used to enable navigation gestures, such as swiping back or forth between views. By storing the navigation state in `@State`, the view can respond to gestures and update its navigation state accordingly.

**Example: TabView with @State**

Here's an example of using `@State` with `TabView`:
```swift
struct MyApp: View {
    @State private var selectedIndex = 0

    var body: some View {
        TabView(selection: $selectedIndex) {
            Text("Tab 1")
                .tabLabel {
                    Image(systemName: "house")
                    Text("Home")
                }
                .tag(0)
            Text("Tab 2")
                .tabLabel {
                    Image(systemName: "gear")
                    Text("Settings")
                }
                .tag(1)
            Text("Tab 3")
                .tabLabel {
                    Image(systemName: "person")
                    Text("Profile")
                }
                .tag(2)
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, `@State` is used to store the selected tab index, which is bound to the `TabView` using the `selection` parameter. When the user taps on a tab, the `selectedIndex` property is updated, which triggers a navigation transition to the corresponding view.

In summary, `@State` is a crucial property wrapper in SwiftUI navigation, as it allows views to store and manage their navigation state, drive navigation transitions, and respond to user interactions.
