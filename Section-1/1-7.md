# How do you use `@main` to mark the entry point of a SwiftUI app?

In SwiftUI, the `@main` attribute is used to mark the entry point of an app, which is the starting point of the app's execution. Here's how to use it:

**What is `@main`?**

`@main` is a special attribute in SwiftUI that indicates the entry point of an app. It's used to specify the type that will be used as the app's main entry point.

**How to use `@main`**

To use `@main`, you need to add the `@main` attribute to a type that conforms to the `App` protocol. This type will be the entry point of your app.

Here's an example:
```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, `MyApp` is the entry point of the app, and it conforms to the `App` protocol. The `body` property returns a `WindowGroup` that contains a `ContentView`.

**What happens when you use `@main`?**

When you use `@main`, SwiftUI will automatically create an instance of the marked type and use it as the app's entry point. This instance will be responsible for creating the app's UI and handling the app's lifecycle.

**Benefits of using `@main`**

Using `@main` provides several benefits:

1. **Simplifies app creation**: With `@main`, you don't need to create a separate `main` function or use a `UIApplication` delegate to launch your app.
2. **Improves code organization**: By marking the entry point of your app with `@main`, you can keep your app's code organized and easy to understand.
3. **Enhances discoverability**: When you use `@main`, Xcode can automatically detect the entry point of your app and provide features like code completion and debugging.

**Conclusion**

In summary, `@main` is a powerful attribute in SwiftUI that marks the entry point of an app. By using `@main`, you can simplify app creation, improve code organization, and enhance discoverability.
