# What is the difference between a `struct` and a `class` in SwiftUI?

In SwiftUI, both `struct` and `class` are used to define custom types, but they have some key differences.

**`struct` (Value Type)**

In SwiftUI, a `struct` is a value type, which means it's a type that stores its own data. Here are some characteristics of `struct`s:

1. **Value semantics**: When you assign a `struct` to a new variable, a copy of the original value is created.
2. **Immutable by default**: `struct`s are immutable by default, which means their properties cannot be changed after initialization.
3. **No inheritance**: `struct`s do not support inheritance.
4. **Automatic memory management**: SwiftUI manages the memory of `struct`s automatically.

**`class` (Reference Type)**

In SwiftUI, a `class` is a reference type, which means it's a type that stores a reference to its data. Here are some characteristics of `class`es:

1. **Reference semantics**: When you assign a `class` to a new variable, both variables point to the same instance.
2. **Mutable by default**: `class` instances can be modified after initialization.
3. **Inheritance**: `class`es support inheritance, which allows you to create a subclass that inherits properties and behavior from a parent class.
4. **Manual memory management**: You need to manage the memory of `class` instances manually using techniques like ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) or manual retain/release.

**When to use `struct` vs `class` in SwiftUI**

Here are some guidelines to help you decide when to use `struct` vs `class` in SwiftUI:

**Use `struct` when:**

1. You need a lightweight, immutable data structure.
2. You want to ensure thread-safety and avoid concurrency issues.
3. You're working with simple, self-contained data models.

**Use `class` when:**

1. You need to create a complex, mutable data model with inheritance.
2. You need to manage a large amount of data or resources.
3. You want to use a delegate pattern or observer pattern.

**Example: `struct` vs `class` in SwiftUI**

Here's an example of a simple `struct` and `class` in SwiftUI:
```swift
// Struct example
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

// Class example
class PersonClass {
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Person` `struct` is a value type, while the `PersonClass` `class` is a reference type.

In summary, `struct`s are value types that are immutable by default, while `class`es are reference types that are mutable by default. Choose the right type based on your specific use case and requirements.
