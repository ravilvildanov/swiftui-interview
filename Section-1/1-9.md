# How do you use `lazy` to create a lazy-loaded property in SwiftUI?

In SwiftUI, you can use the `lazy` keyword to create a lazy-loaded property, which is a property that is initialized only when it's first accessed. Here's how to use `lazy` to create a lazy-loaded property:

**What is `lazy`?**

`lazy` is a keyword in Swift that allows you to create a property that is initialized only when it's first accessed. This is useful when you have a property that is expensive to create or has a significant impact on performance.

**How to use `lazy`**

To use `lazy`, you need to declare a property with the `lazy` keyword, followed by the property's type and an initializer. Here's an example:
```swift
struct MyView: View {
    lazy var expensiveProperty: SomeExpensiveType = {
        // Initialize the property here
        return SomeExpensiveType()
    }()

    var body: some View {
        // Use the lazy property here
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onAppear {
                // The lazy property will be initialized here
                print(expensiveProperty)
            }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `expensiveProperty` is a lazy-loaded property that is initialized only when it's first accessed, which is when the `onAppear` modifier is called.

**How `lazy` works**

When you declare a property with `lazy`, SwiftUI creates a special kind of property that is initialized only when it's first accessed. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. When the property is declared, SwiftUI creates a special kind of storage for the property.
2. When the property is first accessed, SwiftUI initializes the property using the initializer provided.
3. The initialized property is stored in the special storage created in step 1.
4. Subsequent accesses to the property return the stored value.

**Benefits of using `lazy`**

Using `lazy` provides several benefits:

1. **Improved performance**: By delaying the initialization of a property until it's first accessed, you can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.
2. **Reduced memory usage**: If a property is expensive to create, using `lazy` can reduce memory usage by delaying its creation until it's actually needed.
3. **Simplified code**: `lazy` allows you to write simpler code by avoiding the need to manually manage the initialization of a property.

**Common use cases for `lazy`**

Here are some common use cases for `lazy` in SwiftUI:

1. **Expensive computations**: Use `lazy` to delay expensive computations until they're actually needed.
2. **Resource-intensive properties**: Use `lazy` to delay the creation of resource-intensive properties, such as images or large datasets.
3. **Optional properties**: Use `lazy` to delay the creation of optional properties until they're actually needed.

By using `lazy`, you can create more efficient and performant code in SwiftUI.
