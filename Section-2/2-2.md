# What is the difference between `HStack` and `VStack`?

In SwiftUI, `HStack` and `VStack` are two types of stack views that allow you to arrange child views in a horizontal or vertical layout, respectively.

**What is `HStack`?**

`HStack` (short for "Horizontal Stack") is a view that stacks its child views horizontally, from left to right. It's used to create a horizontal layout of views.

**What is `VStack`?**

`VStack` (short for "Vertical Stack") is a view that stacks its child views vertically, from top to bottom. It's used to create a vertical layout of views.

**Key differences**

Here are the key differences between `HStack` and `VStack`:

1. **Layout direction**: `HStack` lays out its child views horizontally, while `VStack` lays out its child views vertically.
2. **Child view arrangement**: In `HStack`, child views are arranged from left to right, while in `VStack`, child views are arranged from top to bottom.
3. **Default spacing**: `HStack` and `VStack` have different default spacing values. `HStack` has a default spacing of 0, while `VStack` has a default spacing of 8.

**When to use each**

Here are some scenarios where you might use each:

* **Use `HStack` when**:
	+ You need to arrange views horizontally, such as a row of buttons or a horizontal navigation bar.
	+ You want to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
* **Use `VStack` when**:
	+ You need to arrange views vertically, such as a list of items or a vertical navigation bar.
	+ You want to create a layout that is more compact and efficient in terms of vertical space.

**Example: `HStack` vs `VStack`**

Here's an example that demonstrates the difference between `HStack` and `VStack`:
```swift
// HStack example
HStack {
    Text("View 1")
    Text("View 2")
    Text("View 3")
}

// VStack example
VStack {
    Text("View 1")
    Text("View 2")
    Text("View 3")
}
```
In the `HStack` example, the three `Text` views are arranged horizontally, from left to right. In the `VStack` example, the three `Text` views are arranged vertically, from top to bottom.

By using `HStack` and `VStack`, you can create flexible and adaptive layouts in SwiftUI that respond to different screen sizes and orientations.
