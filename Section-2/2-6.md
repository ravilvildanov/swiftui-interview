# What is the difference between `Grid` and `LazyGrid`?

In SwiftUI, `Grid` and `LazyGrid` are two views that allow you to create grid-based layouts, but they have some key differences:

**`Grid`**

`Grid` is a view that creates a grid-based layout, where you can arrange views in a flexible and adaptive grid. It's a powerful tool for creating complex layouts that require a grid structure.

Here are some characteristics of `Grid`:

* **Eager loading**: `Grid` loads all its content views at once, which can lead to performance issues if you have a large number of views.
* **Fixed size**: `Grid` has a fixed size, which means that it will not adapt to changes in the size of its content views.
* **No scrolling**: `Grid` does not support scrolling out of the box. If you need scrolling, you'll need to wrap it in a `ScrollView`.

**`LazyGrid`**

`LazyGrid` is a view that creates a lazy grid-based layout, where views are loaded only when they come into view. It's a more efficient and performant alternative to `Grid`.

Here are some characteristics of `LazyGrid`:

* **Lazy loading**: `LazyGrid` loads its content views lazily, which means that only the views that are currently visible are loaded. This can improve performance when dealing with large datasets.
* **Dynamic size**: `LazyGrid` adapts to changes in the size of its content views, which means that it can handle varying sizes and shapes of views.
* **Built-in scrolling**: `LazyGrid` supports scrolling out of the box, which makes it a great choice for large datasets.

**Key differences**

Here are the key differences between `Grid` and `LazyGrid`:

* **Loading behavior**: `Grid` loads all content views at once, while `LazyGrid` loads views lazily.
* **Size behavior**: `Grid` has a fixed size, while `LazyGrid` adapts to changes in the size of its content views.
* **Scrolling support**: `Grid` does not support scrolling out of the box, while `LazyGrid` does.

**When to use each**

Here are some guidelines on when to use each:

* Use `Grid` when:
	+ You have a small, fixed dataset.
	+ You need a fixed grid size.
	+ You don't need scrolling.
* Use `LazyGrid` when:
	+ You have a large dataset.
	+ You need dynamic grid sizing.
	+ You need built-in scrolling support.

In summary, `Grid` is a more traditional grid view that loads all content views at once, while `LazyGrid` is a more efficient and performant alternative that loads views lazily and adapts to changes in the size of its content views.
