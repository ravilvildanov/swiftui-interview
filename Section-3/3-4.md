# How do you use `@Published` to create a publish-subscribe pattern?

In SwiftUI, `@Published` is a property wrapper that creates a publish-subscribe pattern, enabling reactive programming and automatic updates in your app. Here's how to use `@Published` to create a publish-subscribe pattern:

**What is `@Published`?**

`@Published` is a property wrapper that marks a property as a publisher, which notifies subscribers when the property changes. It's a part of the `Combine` framework, which is built into SwiftUI.

**How to use `@Published`**

To use `@Published`, you need to:

1. Create a class that conforms to `ObservableObject`.
2. Mark a property with the `@Published` wrapper.
3. Use the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper in a view to subscribe to the published property.

Here's an example:
```swift
// Step 1: Create a class that conforms to ObservableObject
class User: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name: String = "John Doe"
    @Published var age: Int = 30
}

// Step 2: Mark a property with @Published
// (already done in the User class above)

// Step 3: Use @ObservedObject in a view to subscribe to the published property
struct UserProfile: View {
    @ObservedObject var user: User

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Name: $$user.name)")
            Text("Age: $$user.age)")
            Button("Update Name") {
                user.name = "Jane Doe"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `User` class has two published properties: `name` and `age`. The `UserProfile` view subscribes to these properties using the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper.

**How the publish-subscribe pattern works**

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. When the `User` object is created, it publishes its properties using the `@Published` wrapper.
2. The `UserProfile` view subscribes to the published properties using the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper.
3. When the `name` property changes (e.g., when the button is tapped), the `User` object notifies its subscribers (in this case, the `UserProfile` view).
4. The `UserProfile` view receives the notification and updates its UI automatically.

**Benefits of `@Published`**

Using `@Published` provides several benefits:

* **Reactive programming**: Enables reactive programming, where views react to changes in the data model.
* **Automatic updates**: Views are updated automatically when the data model changes.
* **Decoupling**: Decouples views from the data model, making it easier to modify or replace individual components.

By using `@Published`, you can create a robust and scalable publish-subscribe pattern in your SwiftUI app, enabling automatic updates and reactive programming.
