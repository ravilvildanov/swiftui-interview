# What is the difference between `@State` and `@AppStorage`?

In SwiftUI, `@State` and `@AppStorage` are two property wrappers that serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:

**`@State`**

`@State` is a property wrapper that creates a source of truth for a value within a single view hierarchy. It's used to store temporary, ephemeral data that's specific to a particular view or view hierarchy.

**Characteristics of `@State`**

* **Temporary storage**: Data is stored in memory and is lost when the view is recreated or the app is terminated.
* **View-specific**: Data is specific to a particular view or view hierarchy.
* **Not persisted**: Data is not persisted across app launches or device restarts.

**Example use cases for `@State`**

* Storing temporary user input, such as text field values or toggle switch states.
* Managing the state of a view, such as whether a button is enabled or disabled.

**`@AppStorage`**

`@AppStorage` is a property wrapper that stores small amounts of data in the app's storage, which is a secure and persistent storage area provided by the operating system. It's used to store user preferences, settings, or other data that needs to be persisted across app launches and device restarts.

**Characteristics of `@AppStorage`**

* **Persistent storage**: Data is stored in the app's storage and is persisted across app launches and device restarts.
* **App-wide**: Data is accessible from anywhere in the app.
* **Secure**: Data is stored securely, using the operating system's storage mechanisms.

**Example use cases for `@AppStorage`**

* Storing user preferences, such as theme settings or notification preferences.
* Saving game progress or high scores.
* Storing authentication tokens or other sensitive data.

**Key differences**

* **Persistence**: `@AppStorage` stores data persistently, while `@State` stores data temporarily.
* **Scope**: `@AppStorage` stores data app-wide, while `@State` stores data specific to a particular view or view hierarchy.
* **Security**: `@AppStorage` stores data securely, while `@State` stores data in memory.

In summary, use `@State` for temporary, view-specific data, and use `@AppStorage` for persistent, app-wide data that needs to be secured and persisted across app launches and device restarts.
