# What is the purpose of the `@StateObject` wrapper?

In SwiftUI, the `@StateObject` wrapper is a property wrapper that creates a shared instance of a class that conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol. It's used to manage a shared object that can be accessed and updated by multiple views in a view hierarchy.

**What is `@StateObject`?**

`@StateObject` is a property wrapper that creates a shared instance of a class that conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol. It's similar to `@State`, but instead of storing a simple value, it stores a reference to an object that can be observed and updated.

**Purpose of `@StateObject`**

The purpose of `@StateObject` is to:

1. **Create a shared instance**: Create a shared instance of an `ObservableObject` that can be accessed and updated by multiple views in a view hierarchy.
2. **Manage a shared object**: Manage a shared object that can be used to store and update data that needs to be shared between views.
3. **Enable data sharing**: Enable data sharing between views without having to pass data explicitly between them.

**How to use `@StateObject`**

Here's an example:
```swift
class UserSettings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username: String = "John Doe"
    @Published var isLoggedIn: Bool = false
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var userSettings = UserSettings()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Username: $$userSettings.username)")
            Button("Log in") {
                userSettings.isLoggedIn = true
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ProfileView: View {
    @ObservedObject var userSettings: UserSettings

    init(userSettings: UserSettings) {
        self.userSettings = userSettings
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Username: $$userSettings.username)")
            Button("Log out") {
                userSettings.isLoggedIn = false
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `UserSettings` class conforms to `ObservableObject` and has two published properties: `username` and `isLoggedIn`. The `ContentView` creates a shared instance of `UserSettings` using `@StateObject`, and the `ProfileView` accesses the same instance using `@ObservedObject`.

**Benefits of `@StateObject`**

Using `@StateObject` provides several benefits:

* **Data sharing**: Enables data sharing between views without having to pass data explicitly between them.
* **Decoupling**: Decouples views from each other, making it easier to modify or replace individual views without affecting the rest of the app.
* **Automatic updates**: Enables automatic updates of views when the shared object changes.

By using `@StateObject`, you can create a robust and scalable data sharing mechanism in your SwiftUI app, enabling automatic updates and decoupling between views.
