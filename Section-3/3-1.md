# What is the difference between `@State` and `@Binding`?

In SwiftUI, `@State` and `@Binding` are two types of property wrappers that help you manage state and data flow in your app. While they're related, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

**`@State`**

`@State` is a property wrapper that creates a source of truth for a value within a view. It's used to store a value that's specific to a single view instance. When the value changes, the view will be re-rendered with the new value.

Here's an example:
```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @State private var counter = 0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Increment") {
            counter += 1
        }
        Text("Counter: $$counter)")
    }
}
```
In this example, `counter` is a `@State` property that's initialized to 0. When the button is tapped, the `counter` value is incremented, and the view is re-rendered with the new value.

**`@Binding`**

`@Binding` is a property wrapper that creates a two-way binding between a view and a source of truth. It's used to pass a value from a parent view to a child view, and allows the child view to modify the value, which is then reflected in the parent view.

Here's an example:
```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var counter = 0

    var body: some View {
        ChildView(counter: $counter)
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @Binding var counter: Int

    var body: some View {
        Button("Increment") {
            counter += 1
        }
        Text("Counter: $$counter)")
    }
}
```
In this example, `ParentView` has a `@State` property `counter`, and passes a binding to it to `ChildView` using the `$` symbol. `ChildView` receives the binding as a `@Binding` property, which allows it to modify the `counter` value. When the button is tapped, the `counter` value is incremented, and the change is reflected in `ParentView`.

**Key differences**

Here are the key differences between `@State` and `@Binding`:

* **Scope**: `@State` is used within a single view instance, while `@Binding` is used to pass a value between views.
* **Ownership**: `@State` owns the value, while `@Binding` is a reference to a value owned by another view.
* **Direction**: `@State` is a one-way value, while `@Binding` is a two-way binding.

**When to use each**

Here are some guidelines on when to use each:

* Use `@State` when you need to store a value specific to a single view instance.
* Use `@Binding` when you need to pass a value from a parent view to a child view, and allow the child view to modify the value.

By understanding the differences between `@State` and `@Binding`, you'll be able to manage state and data flow in your SwiftUI app more effectively.
