# How do you use `@FetchRequest` to fetch data from Core Data?

In SwiftUI, `@FetchRequest` is a property wrapper that allows you to fetch data from Core Data and bind it to a view. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `@FetchRequest` to fetch data from Core Data:

**Step 1: Create a Core Data stack**

First, you need to create a Core Data stack in your SwiftUI app. This typically involves creating a `NSPersistentContainer` instance and setting up the Core Data stack.
```swift
import CoreData

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    let persistentContainer = NSPersistentContainer(name: "MyApp")

    init() {
        persistentContainer.loadPersistentStores { _, error in
            if let error = error {
                fatalError("Unresolved error $$error)")
            }
        }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(\.managedObjectContext, persistentContainer.viewContext)
        }
    }
}
```
**Step 2: Define a fetch request**

Next, you need to define a fetch request that specifies the data you want to fetch from Core Data. You can do this using the `NSFetchRequest` class.
```swift
import CoreData

struct Book: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    @objc dynamic var title: String
    @objc dynamic var author: String
}

let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<Book> = Book.fetchRequest()
fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "title", ascending: true)]
```
**Step 3: Use `@FetchRequest` in a view**

Now, you can use the `@FetchRequest` property wrapper in a view to fetch the data from Core Data.
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @FetchRequest(fetchRequest: Book.fetchRequest()) var books: FetchedResults<Book>

    var body: some View {
        List(books, id: \.id) { book in
            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                Text(book.title)
                Text(book.author)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `ContentView` view uses the `@FetchRequest` property wrapper to fetch the `Book` entities from Core Data. The `fetchRequest` parameter specifies the fetch request to use, and the `books` property is an array of `Book` entities that are fetched from Core Data.

**How `@FetchRequest` works**

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. The `@FetchRequest` property wrapper creates a fetch request based on the `fetchRequest` parameter.
2. The fetch request is executed on the Core Data stack's managed object context.
3. The resulting data is stored in the `books` property, which is an array of `Book` entities.
4. The `ContentView` view is updated automatically when the data in Core Data changes.

**Benefits of `@FetchRequest`**

Using `@FetchRequest` provides several benefits:

* **Declarative data fetching**: You can declaratively specify the data you want to fetch from Core Data, without having to write imperative code.
* **Automatic data binding**: The `@FetchRequest` property wrapper automatically binds the fetched data to the view, so you don't need to write code to update the view when the data changes.
* **Efficient data fetching**: `@FetchRequest` uses Core Data's efficient fetching mechanisms, so you don't need to worry about fetching large amounts of data.

By using `@FetchRequest`, you can write concise and efficient code that fetches data from Core Data and binds it to a view.
