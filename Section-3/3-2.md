# How do you use `@EnvironmentObject` to share data between views?

In SwiftUI, `@EnvironmentObject` is a property wrapper that allows you to share data between views by injecting an observable object into the environment of a view hierarchy. This enables you to access and update the shared data from multiple views.

**What is an `EnvironmentObject`?**

An `EnvironmentObject` is an instance of a class that conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol. This protocol requires the class to publish its properties using the `@Published` property wrapper, which notifies observers when the properties change.

Here's an example of a simple `EnvironmentObject`:
```swift
class UserSettings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username: String = "John Doe"
    @Published var isLoggedIn: Bool = false
}
```
**How to use `@EnvironmentObject`**

To use `@EnvironmentObject`, you need to:

1. Create an instance of the `EnvironmentObject` class and inject it into the environment of your app using the `@main` attribute or a `UIHostingController`.
2. Use the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper to inject the `EnvironmentObject` instance into a view.
3. Access and update the shared data from the view using the `EnvironmentObject` instance.

Here's an example:
```swift
// Step 1: Create an instance of the EnvironmentObject class
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @StateObject var userSettings = UserSettings()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(userSettings)
        }
    }
}

// Step 2: Use @EnvironmentObject to inject the EnvironmentObject instance into a view
struct ContentView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var userSettings: UserSettings

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Username: $$userSettings.username)")
            Button("Log in") {
                userSettings.isLoggedIn = true
            }
        }
    }
}

// Step 3: Access and update the shared data from the view
struct ProfileView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var userSettings: UserSettings

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Username: $$userSettings.username)")
            Button("Log out") {
                userSettings.isLoggedIn = false
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `UserSettings` instance is injected into the environment of the app using the `@main` attribute. The `ContentView` and `ProfileView` views use the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper to access the `UserSettings` instance and update the shared data.

**Benefits of using `@EnvironmentObject`**

Using `@EnvironmentObject` provides several benefits:

* **Decoupling**: Views are decoupled from each other, making it easier to modify or replace individual views without affecting the rest of the app.
* **Global access**: Shared data is accessible from any view in the app, without the need for complex navigation or data passing.
* **Automatic updates**: When the shared data changes, all views that use the `@EnvironmentObject` will be updated automatically.

By using `@EnvironmentObject`, you can create a robust and scalable data sharing mechanism in your SwiftUI app.
