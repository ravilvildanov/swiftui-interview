# How do you use `@AppStorage` to store data in the app's storage?

In SwiftUI, `@AppStorage` is a property wrapper that allows you to store small amounts of data, such as user preferences or settings, in the app's storage. Here's how to use `@AppStorage` to store data:

**What is `@AppStorage`?**

`@AppStorage` is a property wrapper that stores a value in the app's storage, which is a secure and persistent storage area provided by the operating system. It's similar to `@State`, but instead of storing data in memory, it stores data in the app's storage.

**How to use `@AppStorage`**

To use `@AppStorage`, you need to:

1. Import the `AppStorage` module.
2. Create a property with the `@AppStorage` wrapper.
3. Specify a unique key for the stored value.

Here's an example:
```swift
import SwiftUI
import AppStorage

struct UserDefaultsView: View {
    @AppStorage("username") var username: String = ""
    @AppStorage("isLoggedIn") var isLoggedIn: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
            Button("Log in") {
                isLoggedIn = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we create two properties: `username` and `isLoggedIn`, and use the `@AppStorage` wrapper to store them in the app's storage. We specify a unique key for each property, which is used to identify the stored value.

**How `@AppStorage` works**

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. When you assign a value to a property with `@AppStorage`, the value is stored in the app's storage.
2. When you access the property, the value is retrieved from the app's storage.
3. If the value is not found in the app's storage, the default value is used.

**Benefits of `@AppStorage`**

Using `@AppStorage` provides several benefits:

* **Persistence**: Data is stored persistently, even when the app is terminated or restarted.
* **Security**: Data is stored securely, using the operating system's storage mechanisms.
* **Easy to use**: `@AppStorage` is easy to use, with a simple and intuitive API.

**Limitations of `@AppStorage`**

While `@AppStorage` is a convenient way to store small amounts of data, it has some limitations:

* **Size limitations**: `@AppStorage` is designed for storing small amounts of data, such as user preferences or settings. It's not suitable for storing large amounts of data.
* **Data types**: `@AppStorage` only supports a limited set of data types, such as `String`, `Bool`, `Int`, and `Double`.

By using `@AppStorage`, you can easily store and retrieve small amounts of data in your SwiftUI app, providing a convenient and secure way to manage user preferences and settings.
